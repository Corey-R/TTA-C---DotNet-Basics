### Twenty One
A cool twenty-one blackjack console app game created from The Tech Academy's video tutorial with instructor "Jesse". During the creation of the game, we covered a variety of basic C# programming, class/methods, using references, creating class libraries, etc. Once the tutorial was complete, we had a fully functioning console game with a few standard error handlings and try/catch blocks to prevent exceptions. The base game is complete, a few features could still be added to give it a more well-rounded user experience (such as adding a database to keep track of user balances should they quit and come back). 

This project was done using Visual Studio 2019 and a Console App with the .NET Framework.

*** Car Insurance 
This was an assignment I was tasked with from The Tech Academy. In this project, I used Visual Studio 2019, C# Language, and ASP.NET Web App MVC. I gained more experience using the Model View Controller architecture by added logic to the Controller section that utilized user input to calculate a personal quote and display that quote back to the user. The ASP.NET auto-generated a basic website and I just builded on top of it. I will make future adjustments to this project so that the home page will be tailored towards the actual Car Insurance.
